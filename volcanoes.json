Lava flows from the central and eastern clusters flowed into Lake Sevan. Initial explosive eruptions in the volcanic field were followed by the extrusion of rhyolitic obsidian lava domes and flows. The latest activity produced a series of andesitic and basaltic-andesite cinder cones and lava flows.
