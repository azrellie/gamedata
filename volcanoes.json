It has been designated a Decade Volcano. The huge Minoan eruption of Santorini in the 17th century BC may have inspired the legend of Atlantis. It was rated 7 in the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program's Volcanic Explosivity Index."

The massive climate-impacting Laki fissure eruption of 1783–1784 was a part of the same fissure system. Grímsvötn was erupting at the same time as Laki during 1783, but continued to erupt until 1785. Because most of the volcanic system lies underneath Vatnajökull, most of its eruptions have been subglacial and the interaction of magma and meltwater from the ice causes phreatomagmatic explosive activity.
