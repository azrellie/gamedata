An array of post-caldera structures is truncated by later calderas, the last three of which formed during the Holocene, about 7,900 and 5,000 BCE and about 240 CE. The latter eruption was the second largest in Kamchatka during the Holocene, and produced about 20 km3 of rhyodacitic airfall tephra and 3-4 km3 of pyroclastic flows. The eastern part of the caldera complex contains two lakes, the northern of which forms an embayment in Shtyubel' (Stubel) Crater, a low-angle cone that began forming about 1,600 years ago in the youngest caldera. The only historical eruption, in 1907, originated from Shtyubel'."

Successive dacitic-to-rhyolitic explosive eruptions from the Goshikiiwa cone led to the formation of the roughly 2-km-wide Nakanoumi caldera, whose SW and NE rims form peninsulas extending into Lake Towada. The andesitic-to-dacitic Ogurayama lava dome was built over the NE rim of Nakanoumi.

That area consists of numerous central cones and maars, the 4.5-km-wide Ikeda caldera, and Kaimondake stratovolcano. The symmetrical andesitic Kaimondake is the most prominent feature, and is capped by a lava dome. Ibusuki has been very active during the Holocene, forming the Ikeda caldera about 4,600 years ago, numerous maars and lava domes. Kaimondake formed during the last 4,000 years, from which all eruptive activity has occurred after about 2,650 years ago. Its last eruption took place in the 9th century. While listed as features of the Ata caldera, JMA (2013) simultaneously listed Kaimondake and the combination of Ikeda and Yamagawa as distinct volcanoes."

A lava tube and channel system extending 5 km SE of the crater displays both roofed and collapsed portions.

During this time, numerous dikes and sills formed, and there were eruptions of basaltic flow. The basalts formed at this time are relatively rich in TiO2 and have a similar composition to continental flood basalts. The second phase lasted from approximately 85 million years ago to 60 million years ago and was characterized by mildly alkaline igneous activity and the eruption of flood basalts. The igneous rocks formed during the second phase have a similar geochemical makeup as the intra-plate composition.",

The 14.5-km-long dacitic lava flow has distal margins that are 350-400 m high and dramatic 30-m-high flow ridges on its surface. The age of the flows was considered to be post-glacial (Guest 1981, pers. comm.), but Argon-Argon dates indicate only that it is less than 100,000 years old (de Silva and Francis, 1991), and based on comparison with nearby dated flows, it was considered to be of Pleistocene age (de Silva, 2007 pers. comm.). The eruption of less than 1 km3 of dacitic pyroclastic flows preceded the initial lava extrusion, which formed the 22 km3 compound main flow. Eruption of a small amount of rhyolitic airfall and growth of a pumice cone was followed by effusion of the final 3 km3 of lava."

An arcuate chain of small cones on the western edge of the summit extends north and south of the pit craters and merges into the crests prominent rift zones. Seismicity indicates a magmatic system distinct from that of Kīlauea. During 1996 a new pit crater formed at the summit, and lava flows were erupted.

It was formed by several rhyolitic eruptions caused by crustal stretching during the Ouachita orogeny about 32 million years ago. The high magnetic waves present in the northern part of the caldera are believed to be from a broad intrusion, which indicates a partial crustal boundary of the Ouachita orogeny. This feature represents the largest intrusion, (24–38 km (15–24 mi), 1–4 km (0.62–2.49 mi) thick, 700–3,000 km3 (170–720 cu mi) in volume) in an area where laccoliths are ubiquitous.

Historical eruptions during the 19th and 20th centuries have sometimes occurred simultaneously from both calderas, and have consisted of small-to-moderate phreatic eruptions, some of which formed ephemeral islands in Denham caldera.

In January 1902 the volcano was reported to be smoking heavily for several days, with occasional strong night-time glow. A lava flow was reported in 1993, but may have been a mistaken observation of a molten sulfur flow. Despite these reports there is no clear evidence for Holocene activity. The youngest date obtained by Pang et al. (2014), using U-Pb on a zircon, was about 800 ka. Biabangard and Moradian (2008) obtained K-Ar dates around 700 ka."

The sediment-free pillow lavas have a dark glassy crust at water depths of between 4,100 and 4,450 m, believed to be the deepest historical eruption known, and the first to be found along a slow-spreading ridge. This location, the segment centered at 15.5°N, is part of a line of recently surveyed spreading segments with anomalous hydrothermal plumes. The line parallels the Mariana Island chain (about 100 km E) and the Mariana Trench (about 300 km E)."

Period 1 was dominated by pyroclastics and minor lava flows, Period 2 involved the emplacement of intermediate to felsic lavas that constructed the main cone. The post-caldera activity of Period 3 produced mafic lavas, scoria, and phreatomagamtic products. Vico also has a few post-caldera monogenetic centers, the largest of which is the Monte Venere cone inside the caldera (Peccerillo, 2005).

The youngest dated activity at the complex produced La Dieta airfall deposit about 31,000 years ago, and persistent local seismicity continues at Zitácuaro. The Valle de Bravo area to the south contains dominantly andesitic lava domes and flows, many of which were erupted along regional faults.

Other smaller volcanic systems are Morlupo, Vigna di Valle, Trevignano, and Baccano (Conticelli et al., 1997). The Sacrofano and Bacciano centers dominate the five phases of the complex's eruptive history. The first two phases involved intense explosive activity at Sacrofano and Molupa (0.6-0.4 Ma), resulting in tuffs, ashes, and pyroclastic flows during the pre-Sacrofano Caldera stage. During the third phase, hydro-magmatic eruptions formed the Sacrofano Caldera and minor lava flows occurred in the post-caldera stage. In the western sector, a stratovolcano and the Bracciano Caldera developed, along with fissure eruptions that produced flood lavas greater than 100 km3, air-fall tuffs, and surge deposits. Activity at small eruptive vents on the rims of the collapsed Bracciano and Sacrofano Calderas dominated the fourth phase, resulting in pyroclastics at Bracciano along with cinder cones and lava flows at Sacrofano. Hydro-magmatic activity localized between the two calderas, which produced tuff rings, cones, and maars, dominated the final phase (Conticelli et al., 1997)."

The bulk of the complex appears to have been erupted between 100,000 and 500,000 years ago, but postglacial andesitic and basaltic-andesite cones and lava flows are also present. Anomalously old Potassium-Argon (K-Ar) dates of 1.0 and 1.1 Ma were obtained from a lava flow in the postglacial Pashleth and Machmel Creek valleys. This flow is clearly much younger than the K-Ar date, and high-energy glacial streams have only begun to etch a channel along the margin. A radiocarbon date from barnacles 8.5 km upstream from the mouth of Machmel River, and buried by the flow, yielded an age of 12,200 ± 140 years. This is a maximum age for the flow, which could be much younger."

The volcanic field is part of a larger volcanic province that clusters around the Colca River and is mostly of Pleistocene age, although the Andagua sector also features volcanic cones with historical activity, with the last eruption about 370 years ago. Eruptions were mostly effusive, generating lava flows, cones and small eruption columns. Future eruptions are possible, and there is ongoing fumarolic activity. Volcanic activity in the field has flooded the Andahua valley with lava flows, damming local watersheds in the Laguna de Chachas, Laguna Mamacocha and Laguna Pumajallo lakes and burying the course of the Andagua River. The Andahua valley segment of the larger volcanic province was declared a geopark in 2015."

A major eruption about 6,500 years ago, it's largest eruptive event during the Holocene, was accompanied by a collapse that sent lahars down the Nooksack drainage. Early settlers in the Puget Sound region as far away as Victoria, British Columbia, observed 19th-century activity, all of which consisted of relatively minor phreatic eruptions. Sherman Crater, the historically active crater immediately south of the summit, has been the site of increased steam emission since 1975. The Nooksack Indian Tribe referred to the volcano as Kweq Smaenit, the White Mountain. The Lummi Nation knew Mount Baker as Koma Kulshan."

Activity spanning about 825,000 years began with eruptions of the Rockland caldera complex and was followed beginning about 590,000 years ago by construction of Brokeoff stratovolcano. Beginning about 310,000 years ago activity shifted to the north flank of Brokeoff, where episodic, more silicic eruptions produced the Lassen dome field, a group of 30 dacitic lava domes including Bumpass Mountain, Mount Helen, Ski Heil Peak, and Reading Peak. At least 12 eruptive episodes took place during the past 100,000 years, with Lassen Peak being constructed about 27,000 years ago. The Chaos Crags dome complex was constructed about 1100-1000 years ago north of Lassen Peak. The Cinder Cone complex NE of Lassen Peak was erupted in a single episode several hundred years before present and is considered part of the Lassen volcanic center (Clynne et al., 2000). The 1914-1917 eruptions of Lassen Peak began with phreatic eruptions and included emplacement of a small summit lava dome, subplinian explosions, mudflows, and pyroclastic flows."

At least 40 explosive eruptions have been documented during the past 10,000 years, making it the most active volcano of the eastern Aleutian arc. A dominantly andesitic pre-caldera volcano was constructed above basement Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentary rocks that are exposed in the caldera walls to elevations of about 610 m. The ice-free caldera floor contains many pyroclastic cones, tuff cones, maars, and lava domes. Surprise Lake on the NE side drains through The Gates, a steep-walled breach on the east side of the 1-km-high caldera rim that was the site of catastrophic draining of a once larger lake about 1850 years BP. Vent Mountain and Half Cone are two long-lived vents on the south-central and NW caldera floor, respectively.

Frequent explosive eruptions have occurred during the past 4,000 years, sometimes accompanied by pyroclastic flows and surges.

During this time, there were three main episodes of volcanism. The first phase developed hydromagmatic scoria cones and tuff rings of mafic composition. The second phase involved both effusive and explosive hydromagmatic activity, producing scoria and lava flows. The third phase produced basaltic lava flows, scoria deposits, and some hydromagmatic deposits, during which time the largest cones on the island formed (Peccerillo, 2005).

The eruption produced lava flows that traveled 8 km and overran several villages."

The volcano lies at the northern tip of the elongated Kiska Island, across a low isthmus containing East Kiska and West Kiska lakes. A 400-m-wide elliptical crater, breached to the north, caps the 1220-m-high stratovolcano. The volcano is surrounded on three sides by sea cliffs up to 450 m high and overlies an older volcanic center exposed to the south. A massive submarine debris-avalanche deposit extends 40 km to the NNW. The southern part of the NE-SW-trending island, the westernmost of the Rat Island group, has been glaciated, but all lava flows post-date the last major glaciation. Young, steep-sided blocky lava flows, primarily on the N and SW flanks, have originated from vents at locations ranging from the summit to near sea level. A flank cinder cone and associated lava flows were erupted in 1962 at Sirius Point on the northern coast. The island contains one of the best harbors in the Aleutian Islands, but is uninhabited."

            "desc": "Semisopochnoi, the largest subaerial volcano of the western Aleutians, is 20 km wide at sea level and contains an 8-km-wide caldera. It formed as a result of collapse of a low-angle, dominantly basaltic volcano following the eruption of a large volume of dacitic pumice. The high point of the island is Anvil Peak, a double-peaked late-Pleistocene cone that forms much of the island's northern part. The three-peaked Mount Cerberus (renamed Mount Young in 2023) was constructed within the caldera during the Holocene. Each of the peaks contains a summit crater; lava flows on the N flank appear younger than those on the south side. Other post-caldera volcanoes include the symmetrical Sugarloaf Peak SSE of the caldera and Lakeshore Cone, a small cinder cone at the edge of Fenner Lake in the NE part of the caldera. Most documented eruptions have originated from Young, although Coats (1950) considered that both Sugarloaf and Lakeshore Cone could have been recently active."

The islands include Khvostof, Pyramid, Lopy, and Davidof; the latter three form the eastern rim of the mostly submarine caldera, sometimes referred to as the Aleutian Krakatau. The islands were constructed above a roughly 100-m-deep submarine platform extending NW to Segula Island; the floor of the caldera lies 80 m below sea level. The islands are vegetated, but lava flows are recognizable, and Smith et al. (1978) suggested a possible Holocene age."

The older western center consists of the eroded remnants of four overlapping stratovolcanoes that form a linear, NNE-trending ridge. Cinder cones and fissure-fed lava flows extend from the western end of the complex. The younger eastern complex consists of a shield volcano capped by two nested calderas. The 3.5-km-wide Coats caldera is located within an older 10 x 13 km caldera and contains cinder cones and a lava field. Two areas of youthful lava flows extend down the flank through a gap in the SW caldera rim and cover the upper N flank of the caldera. Vents are found on the flanks of the caldera within a kilometer of its rim. A post-caldera cone is capped by a small summit crater. The eastern center is presumably the source of eruptions recorded since the early 1800s. "
